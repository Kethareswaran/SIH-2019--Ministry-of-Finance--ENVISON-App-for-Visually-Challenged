# Envision---Best-Innovative-MHRD-AICTE-SIH-2019-Project
ENVISION is a mobile banking app for the visually impaired, elderly and illiterate people. Currently, there are almost no features on mobile banking apps to assist the Visually Impaired - especially people with 100% blindness. As of now, features like screen readers and tap-based readers are available but these are error prone and haven’t really been optimized to save time and effort on the user’s part. This time consumption and error-filled process isn’t really suitable for banking operations, due to the time involved as well as the lack of security in simply reading out the options. Unlike the above, ENVISION is built from ground up with the requirements of the visually impaired in mind.
